If the goal is to show how the time spent in each activity changes after a major event happens, displaying the difference in time on the y-axis is effective because it directly encodes the difference so that the viewer does not need to compute the difference on their own. However, if the goal is to illustrate how this difference varies across different major events (e.g., COVID vs. 9/11), as visualized at the bottom, it is challenging to tell which activity has a largest difference in terms of the change between these two events because computing the gap between two bars is effortful and slow. One way to address this is to encode that gap directly on the plot.

If the goal is to show which age group changes the most for each category, placing the dots of the age groups at the same x position is effective because it makes the age group that changes the most stands out promptly from the plot. However, if the goal is to show the trend of the change in time spent in each category from 2019 to 2020 when people get older, encoding age groups with shape is hard for the viewer to see the trend of aging easily because shape is only good for nominal variable not ordinary variably. Perhaps consider using other encoding that is effective for ordinary variable (e.g., color intensity encoding).

If the goal is to show the relationship between the number of household children and the time spent on family call time, superimposing the two trends on the same plot makes it easy to see that the drop in the number of household children is couple with the rise in the family call time . However, if the goal is to show the difference in the pattern between males and females (e.g., showing that the time on phone of females is 3x that of males), displaying the two trends separately with different scale for the average family call time make it hard to tell the difference between sexes. Perhaps fixing the scale for the average family call time between males and females could make the comparison between sexes easier.

If the goal is to show the (roughly) negative correlation between average time spent on healthcare and the time on exercise activity, showing the data with a stacked bar graph illustrates the pattern clearly. However, if the goal is to show how the distance between the "binomial distribution peaks" changes while aging, it is hard to promptly see the distance for each age group on the plot. Perhaps directly annotating the distance between the binomial distribution peaks for each age group would help.

If the goal is to show each the pattern between volunteering time and age for each unique education level, your design make it easy to look up the pattern given an education level of interest. However, if the goal is to compare the patterns across education levels, then showing the trends in separate panels make it hard to compare between education levels. One way to address this is to superimpose the trends of different age groups on the same plot.

If the goal is to show the trends of time spent on different counterparties on telephone when people age, visualizing the trends with the same aligned x-axis makes it easy to see the change in each activity at any given age because it is directly encoded by the value of the slope. However, if the goal is to compare the absolute amount of time between different counterparties on telephone, the fact that you use different scales for the y axis makes it hard to tell which one is the most important one at any given age.

If the goal is to show the negative correlation between sleep time and sport time regardless of the sport time, showing the trend by a stacked bar plot makes it easy to see the relationship between total sport time and the sleep time. However, if the goal is to show the trend between each individual sport type and sleep time, using a stacked bar plot makes it hard to compare a specific sport type across sleep time because they are on a unaligned scale for the y axis. Perhaps showing all sport time on an aligned scale for the y axis can help.
